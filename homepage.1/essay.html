        <p>A few blocks down from Soho, a place that is well known by tourists, filled with the latest fashion trends and overpriced fast food restaurants is a neighborhood called Chinatown. A neighborhood rich in its culture and provides a safe place for Chinese immigrants. The history behind Chinatown holds more value than what Americans see themselves when visiting. It’s a place more than sidewalks filled with aunts on Mott Street standing next to their carts shouting “卖小笼包!" (selling soup dumplings), convincing you to buy it since 3 cost “only” $8. It’s a place more than sidewalks filled with fruit stands. A place worth more than just tourists visiting, taking endless amounts of photos of its unique scenery. Within Chinatown there's a restaurant called the Royal Seafood Restaurant, a restaurant that unifies people of different backgrounds to its culture.</p>
        
        <p>The Royal Seafood Restaurant is a Dim Sum Restaurant that bridges and connects people with different cultural backgrounds together. Growing up I've spent my entire childhood eating at this restaurant with my family. Oftentimes we would go here for any special event such as a family reunion. My grandma lives in Philadelphia and since she doesn't have a car, the chances of her coming to New York to visit us are very slim. The first destination we would go to once she got off the bus would be to this restaurant.</p>
            
        <p>The Royal Seafood Restaurant is unique amongst all other restaurants in its diversity. It is a melting pot for people of all sorts of cultural backgrounds. Food served in bamboo steamers by waitresses pushing carts screaming out “虾饺” (shrimp dumplings), “烧卖” (pork dumplings), “糯米鸡” (sticky rice chicken lotus leaf wrap), basically whatever they had to offer on their cart. Each dish served is steaming hot, the savory taste of the food is worth burning your tongue for. Many tourists come to the Royal Seafood Restaurant as it is one of the most traditional Dim Sum restaurants. The most common food they would order are “凤爪” (chicken feet) and “小笼包” (steamed soup dumplings) as those are sought to be the most hyped up traditional food to try. My personal favorite dish to order is “虾肠粉” (shrimp rice noodle rolls), literally amazing. Eating the rice noodle roll itself would be such a hassle since it is very fragile. You would need to take a fork to slice it up, poke it with the shrimp and then dip it in soy sauce for its flavoring. I remember when I was younger, back to when my grandma first ordered this dish for me I was so reluctant to try it and now it is my go to dish to order.</p>
        
        <p>Upon entering the restaurant, you would automatically be blinded by the endless amount of light glistening on your face, the ceiling filled with light bulbs and chandeliers. The place is filled with many traditional decor; round tables and chairs covered with cloth, Asian artwork hung throughout the walls as well as signs of words of wisdom said by philosophers. The Royal Seafood Restaurant is always crowded. Just waiting for a table would take 30 minutes at the minimum. There would be a person on the microphone calling out numbers for when a table is available.</p>
            
        <p>When I was younger, I was very impatient, waiting 30 minutes really put my patience to its test. The walkway to the table itself was very narrow, so narrow that you had to walk sideways like a crab just to pass through. My mom constantly reminded me “it’s not very often that your grandma comes out to New York to visit us, you should enjoy and appreciate the few hours while she is here because you never know when she’ll be coming out to visit us again,” but me being me, I blew off her words because in my mind I knew I would see my grandma again because even if she didn’t come out to New York to visit us, every summer we would go visit her.</p>
            
        <p>Time flies and quarantine hits, bus services are closed, restaurants and dining places are closed, public transportation is limited, everyone is stuck at home and this is when my vision shifts. My eyes opened and I realized how much of the time I have wasted and took for granted while my grandma was out here visiting us. It's been three years since I've last seen my grandma and I miss her. Although facetiming is an option, it is just not the same as seeing them in person. Now looking back, I really regret not appreciating the times I had with her because now I'm counting down the days until the time I get to see her again. I learned to value the time you have with your loved one before it's gone.</p>
